"""HTTP telemetry client for LLM Council.

This module provides an HTTP-based telemetry implementation that sends
anonymized voting data to the Council Cloud ingestion service.

Privacy Notice (ADR-001):
- OFF level: No data transmitted
- ANONYMOUS level: Only voting data (rankings, durations, model counts)
- DEBUG level: + query_hash for troubleshooting (no actual query text)

Usage:
    from llm_council.telemetry_client import HttpTelemetry
    from llm_council.telemetry import set_telemetry

    client = HttpTelemetry(
        endpoint="https://ingest.llmcouncil.ai/v1/events",
        level="anonymous"
    )
    set_telemetry(client)
