"""Council runner for SSE streaming (ADR-025a Phase 3).

This module provides an async generator wrapper around the council
for streaming events to SSE clients.

The implementation uses the on_event callback mechanism in EventBridge
to capture council events in real-time and yield them as they occur.

Usage:
    from llm_council.webhooks._council_runner import run_council

    async for event in run_council("What is AI?"):
        print(event)  # {"event": "council.complete", "data": {...}}
